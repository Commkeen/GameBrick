GameBrick - A C# Gameboy Emulator

This is a mostly-working emulator for original Gameboy games.  Its purpose is for the code to be as easy to understand as possible, to help people making their own emulator or beginning to learn assembly.

Eventually I hope to use this emulator as the basis of a Unity emulator which will provide visualizations of what the processor and GPU are doing, what's stored across the Gameboy's memory, etc.

Building and running the emulator through the SdlHost project requires SdlDotNet to be installed - the emulator can also be run as a Unity plugin.
